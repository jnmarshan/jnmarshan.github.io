### Intergenerational link of female labor force participation: Evidence from Indonesia
Abstract:
I investigate the existence of intergenerational link of female labor force participation in Indonesia using a rich large-scale longitudinal data known as Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). The IFLS gives opportunity to draw intergenerational link between mother’s and daughter’s labor force participation. This study contributes to limited empirical evidence on intergenerational link in female labor market in a developing country setup. I find that such intergenerational link exist, in particular, for those who live in urban area. Mother’s participation effect, albeit small, is four times larger in size than the effect of additional one year of education to daughter’s labor force participation. This suggests meaningful and the importance of intergenerational belief transfer in shaping the next generation of female labor force. I also find that community that adopts pro-gender norms preserve and strengthen the intergenerational link. Finally, I provide evidence that transfer of gender role belief from mother to daughter as the plausible mechanism.

### [Structural Transformation and the Release of Labor from Agriculture.](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/400586/indonesia-enhancing-productivity-quality-jobs.pdf) With [Asep Suryahadi](https://smeru.or.id/en/content/asep-suryahadi) and [Veto Indrio](https://www.smeru.or.id/en/content/veto-tyas-indrio)
Abstract:
Structural transformation in Indonesia has been characterized by faster output
than employment shifts from agriculture to industry and services. As a result, the
ratio of output contribution to employment contribution in the agriculture sector
has fallen relative to the other sectors. The finding from the long-term employment
transformation matrix (1997−2014) in this study confirms that people who started
working in the rural agriculture sector have a lower probability of moving to other
sectors, especially to urban-located sectors. Furthermore, despite the continuing
new entry of younger cohorts into the labor market, this dynamic in employment
transformation has not changed much during the last 2 decades. This phenomenon
may have a role in explaining the stagnation in poverty reduction and the increase in
inequality in recent years.

### Quality-quantity trade-off: an evidence from Indonesia.
Abstract:
This paper provides evidence on quantity and quality trade-off (Becker and Lewis, 1973) existence in Indonesia using variation of province-level total fertility rate by cohorts as an instrument variable. I use the fact that Indonesia’s nationwide family planning policy, known as Keluarga Berencana, became ineffective due to weaker implementation, after an exogenous political shock in 1998 that dramatically turn Indonesia into more decentralized regime. This event unexpectedly have plateaued total fertility rate in Indonesia post-1998. Using the fourth wave Indonesia Family Life Survey data, I investigate the trade-off on children aged less than 15 years old who are born between 1992 and 2006. As contribution to previous efforts (Millimet and Wang, 2011), this paper also investigate such trade-off separately for urban and rural settings. I find trade-off exists only for height-for-age in rural areas. It does exists for year of schooling and has greater impact for urban samples. These results support the argument of potential role of public goods provision in reducing the cost of trade-off (Angrist et al., 2010). My findings robust over alternative instrument variable constructions, birth order effect, and falsification test. The results support rising concern on the need of revitalization of family planning policy in Indonesia.
