### Intergenerational link of female labor force participation: Evidence from Indonesia
Abstract:
I investigate the existence of an intergenerational link between women’s labor supply decisions in Indonesia using rich large-scale longitudinal data known as the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). This study contributes to limited empirical evidence on the intergenerational link in female attachment in the labor market in the context of a developing country. In addition to cross-sectional correlation, I employ a permanent component approach (Chadwick and Solon, 2002; Galassi et al., 2019) to estimate the intergenerational correlation between the mother’s lifetime employment and the daughter’s lifetime employment. I find that a mother’s employment affects her daughter’s employment decision in the future. From the baseline specification result, this intergenerational link coefficient is equivalent to more than two additional years of education. This suggests meaningfulness and the importance of intergenerational belief transfer in shaping the next generation of the female labor force. Finally,I provide evidence that the role-model effects and occupation-specific human capital transfer are the main plausible mechanism behind the intergenerational correlation. The study highlights the challenges of any efforts to improve the female labor supply
given a slowly changing social norms society.

### Why do young females delay labor market participation in rural Indonesia? A cohort analysis using maximum entropy approach
Abstract:
Rural females born in the late 80s and younger in Indonesia were less likely to partici pate in the labor market relative to their older counterparts who were born three decades earlier. The opposite trend however emerges for urban women. The interaction between two opposing trends is arguably the main culprit to the decades-long stagnation in female labor force participation in Indonesia. I construct a synthetic panel of cohorts using 30 years-long of repeated cross-sectional household survey data, namely SAKERNAS and SUSENAS. Focusing on the multi-generation of rural women, I employ the age-period-cohort model (Browning et al., 2012) to shed light on key factors that drive the negative
cohort effect of labor force participation. The results suggest at least two important insights. Firstly, albeit more young women opt out the unpaid family job, I do not find evidence that improved education drives women out of the labor market as indicated by previous findings (Schaner and Das, 2016). Secondly, the negative cohort effect is largely driven by the married women with kids group. This suggests that childbearing cost isan important issue over generations in rural areas, despite a significant drop in fertility, as found in other countries (Klasen et al., 2020). My results challenge the adequacy of the current campaign on lifting female labor force participation by only focusing on
improving access to education in rural areas and providing access to childcare in urban areas.

### Unlucky and scarred: long-term consequences of labor market entry condition in Indonesia
Abstract:
This paper provides empirical evidence of the long-term consequences of labor market entrance conditions using Indonesian data. I exploit the fact that since the Asian Financial Crisis hit in 1997/1998, Indonesia suffered a spike in the unemployment rate that prolonged for almost a decade. I collect and harmonize a long series of Indonesian labor market surveys (SAKERNAS) spanning over 30 years to construct a pseudo-panel
cohort of new labor market entrants from 1990 to 2019. Following Kahn (2010) and Oreopoulos et al. (2012), I exploit exogenous temporal variation of the unemployment rate at the national level and province level to test the existence of scarring effects. To deal with endogenous migration issues for the province-level specification, I constructed a migration-weighted unemployment rate (Schwandt and von Wachter, 2019) based on his-torical inter-province migration patterns from the Population Census. I find evidence of a scarring effect where a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate at the year of labor market entrance causes about 15% loss in probability to be employed full-time
and about 26% potential monthly income loss. The negative effects of the unemployment rate in the initial year on employment and income linger up to 11 years after entering the labor market. I find women and men share similar burdens in terms of negative employment effects, but larger negative income effects for women.

### [Structural Transformation and the Release of Labor from Agriculture.](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/400586/indonesia-enhancing-productivity-quality-jobs.pdf)

Abstract:
Structural transformation in Indonesia has been characterized by faster output
than employment shifts from agriculture to industry and services. As a result, the
ratio of output contribution to employment contribution in the agriculture sector
has fallen relative to the other sectors. The finding from the long-term employment
transformation matrix (1997−2014) in this study confirms that people who started
working in the rural agriculture sector have a lower probability of moving to other
sectors, especially to urban-located sectors. Furthermore, despite the continuing
new entry of younger cohorts into the labor market, this dynamic in employment
transformation has not changed much during the last 2 decades. This phenomenon
may have a role in explaining the stagnation in poverty reduction and the increase in
inequality in recent years.

### Quality-quantity trade-off: an evidence from Indonesia.
Abstract:
This paper provides evidence on quantity and quality trade-off (Becker and Lewis, 1973) existence in Indonesia using variation of province-level total fertility rate by cohorts as an instrument variable. I use the fact that Indonesia’s nationwide family planning policy, known as Keluarga Berencana, became ineffective due to weaker implementation, after an exogenous political shock in 1998 that dramatically turn Indonesia into more decentralized regime. This event unexpectedly have plateaued total fertility rate in Indonesia post-1998. Using the fourth wave Indonesia Family Life Survey data, I investigate the trade-off on children aged less than 15 years old who are born between 1992 and 2006. As contribution to previous efforts (Millimet and Wang, 2011), this paper also investigate such trade-off separately for urban and rural settings. I find trade-off exists only for height-for-age in rural areas. It does exists for year of schooling and has greater impact for urban samples. These results support the argument of potential role of public goods provision in reducing the cost of trade-off (Angrist et al., 2010). My findings robust over alternative instrument variable constructions, birth order effect, and falsification test. The results support rising concern on the need of revitalization of family planning policy in Indonesia.
