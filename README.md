## Welcome to my website

I am PhD candidate in economics at Research School of Economics, The Australian National University. My research interest lies between labour economics, gender economics and development economics. My main research topic is female labour force participation in Indonesia.

## Research highlights

### [Intergenerational link in women employment: evidence from Indonesia](https://jnmarshan.github.io/docs/motherdaughter_web.pdf)
I investigate the existence of an intergenerational link between women’s labour supply decisions in Indonesia using rich large-scale longitudinal data known as the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS). I employ a permanent component approach (Chadwick and Solon, 2002; Galassi et al., 2019) to estimate the intergenerational correlation between the mother’s lifetime employment and the daughter’s lifetime employment. I find that a mother’s employment affects her daughter’s employment decision in the future.This intergenerational link coefficient is equivalent to more than two additional years of education. I provide evidence that the role-model effects and occupation-specific human capital transfer are the main plausible mechanism behind the intergenerational correlation. The study highlights the challenges of any efforts to improve the female labour supply given a slowly changing social norms society.

### [Labour market effects of bushfires and floods in Australia: a gendered perspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-4932.12688)
_with [Josiah Hickson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-hickson-a36a4010a/?originalSubdomain=au)_ | _Economic Records Volume 98, Issue S1 pages 1-25_

We study the labour market effects of bushfires and floods within Australia over the past two decades, focusing on gender as a determinant of vulnerability. Whilst floods unambiguously lifted the labour supply of both genders (creating around 13,500 jobs per year), the likelihood of female employment is particularly vulnerable to bushfires – lowering by 1.6 percentage points (or around 5,000 jobs per year). This effect is partially explained by industry sector, with bushfires lifting overall male employment through industries including mining and transport, whilst reducing more female dominated services-sector participation. We also examine intrahousehold dynamics, finding strongevidence for an ‘added worker’ effect.

### [Unlucky and scarred: long-term consequences of labour market entry condition in Indonesia](https://jnmarshan.github.io/docs/unluckyscarriing_web.pdf)
I exploit the fact that since the Asian Financial Crisis hit in 1997/1998, Indonesia suffered a spike in the unemployment rate that prolonged for almost a decade. I collect and harmonize a long series of Indonesian labour market surveys (SAKERNAS) spanning over 30 years to construct a pseudo-panel cohort of new labour market entrants from 1990 to 2019. Following Kahn (2010) and Oreopoulos et al. (2012), I exploit exogenous temporal variation of the unemployment rate at the national level and province level to test the existence of scarring effects. I find evidence of a scarring effect where a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate at the year of labour market entrance causes about 15% loss in probability to be employed full-time and about 26% potential monthly income loss. I find women and men share similar burdens in terms of negative employment effects, but larger negative income effects for women.
